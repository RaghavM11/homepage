## About Me

 I am a Graduate Student in Automotive Engineering at the University of Michigan, working on deep learning based SLAM. I hold a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering with focus on mechatronics, and I worked for three years at Varroc Technical Center (R&D) as a center of competency engineer.

 My research interests lie in the interplay between computer vision and 3D geometry, with focus on visual localization and mapping for autonomous systems. On a broader level it covers 3D/4D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and sensor fusion for mobile robotic applications in highly challenging environments. I find particular interest in the use these technologies for the greater good!

 In my free time i like to play Squash, Soccer and sometimes pickleball.

 Thanks for visiting my page and feel free to reach out!
