      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

 I am a Graduate Student in Automotive Engineering at the University of Michigan, working on deep learning based SLAM. I hold a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering with focus on mechatronics, and I worked for three years at Varroc Technical Center (R&D) as a center of competency engineer.

 My research interests lie in the interplay between computer vision and 3D geometry, with focus on visual localization and mapping for autonomous systems. On a broader level it covers 3D/4D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and sensor fusion for mobile robotic applications in highly challenging environments. I find particular interest in the use these technologies for the greater good!

 In my free time i like to play Squash, Soccer and pickleball.
